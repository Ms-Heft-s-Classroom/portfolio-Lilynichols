<p> Evermore is a folk-sounding with a kinda of walking in the woods while its fall feel to it. With this album it is definitely a good one to listen to when it's raining or you are calmer because of the feel of it, or if you like me you will listen to it no matter what because I listen to the most not uplifting music all of the time. But this album has some masterpieces on it like champagne problems and no body no crime and Tolerate it.</P>
