<p> Evermore is a folk-sounding with a kinda of walking in the woods while its fall feel to it. With this album it is definitely a good one to listen to when it's raining or you are calmer because of the feel of it, or if you like me you will listen to it no matter what because I listen to the most not uplifting music all of the time. But this album has some masterpieces on it like champagne problems and no body no crime and Tolerate it.</P>

<p>Wake Up and ITs Over is a album by Lovejoy wich is one of my favorite bands EVER.They mke indie punk music with a bit of rock influance, If you listen to the Artic MOnkeys or Los cappesinos! they take influance from both of thoes bands. Some of my favprtite songs from this album are Its Golden Hour Somewhere and Warsaw</p>
