<h6>Taylor Swift-Wikipedia-BY</h6>
<p> Evermore is a folk-sounding with a kinda of walking in the woods while its fall feel to it. With this album it is definitely a good one to listen to when it's raining or you are calmer because of the feel of it, or if you like me you will listen to it no matter what because I listen to the most not uplifting music all of the time. But this album has some masterpieces on it like Champagne Problems and No Body No Crime and Tolerate It.</P>

<h6>Lovejoy-Wikipedia-BY</h6>
<p>Wake Up and Its Over is an album by Lovejoy which is one of my favorite bands EVER. They make indie punk music with a bit of rock influence, If you listen to the Artic MOnkeys or Los cappesinos! they take influence from both of those bands. Some of my favorite songs from this album are It's Golden Hour Somewhere and Warsaw</p>

<h6>Lana Del Rey-Wikipedia-BY</h6>
<p> Did You Know There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd is an album by Lana del Rey, It is a 70's-inspired folk and soul-type music. Lana is a really talented lyricist and she really shows that in this album, she has so much emotion and so many things that are relatable. She talks about being in love and loving someone but also mentions political issues that I really really love her for talking about. Some of my favorite songs off of the album are A&W, Peppers, Paris Texas, and Candy Necklace.</p>
