            <p2> I thought this book was really good! I think itâ€™s definitely more of an advanced book in a way because of how everything is described but it had a lot of plot twists that I didn't expect but that made it even better! This book had a good amount of mystery to it and i really enjoyed it!</p2>

            <p2> I honestly loved this book so much! I liked how it was written and I thought it talked about so many important things that you feel and see in an unhealthy relationship. I overall really liked the plot and liked the character development. This book was one of the first more adult romance books that I read and I really enjoyed it. I think talking about how things affect the brain is important and this does just that. </p2>
